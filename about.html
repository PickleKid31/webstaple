      <p>Hello, and welcome to webstaple. Websites for me started out as more of a dream. Like, how cool would that be if I had my very own up on the web? Then one day I discovered something called github. Github allowed me to code my very own website and host it on the web for free! I was so happy at first, and then I remembered I din't have the slightest ideas how to code. So, for me, it started out as me just copying and pasting html from websites I use daily. So my first website, which you can visit <a href="picklekid31.github.io">here,</a> Was basic HTML with trace amounts of CSS. Then one fateful day, my school found my website popping up in people's history and, of course, blocked it. I think now is the time to tell you I do most of my work on a school computer, so when that happened I was devastated. For weeks I searched for some way to put another website up on the web. Then finally I discovered netlify. I could host another website! I was very happy and this time before I started coding I found a coding book in my house no one in my family had ever read, and it taught me basic HTML and CSS! With the foundation set, my coding skills began to grow, and as that happened, so did my ambitions for building websites. My friend and I build a website called <a href ="tarsh.netlify.app/home.html">tarsh,</a> and that looked pretty good, so I decided to build a website on my own. Webstaple was born. My best work of art by far. So here you are! My coding skills continued to advance and now I am very pround of what I have created. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I do!</p>
